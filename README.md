**Create a FPS Shooter game with a 3rd person camera view.**

- Movement (W,A,S,D), Jump, run with "Shift" key.    (done, + R for reload, F for fire)
- AIM with mouse.    (done)
- Create enemies with Health, detect zone from player, any attack.      (done)
- Deal damage to enemy.     (enemy dies when shot)
- Inventory system with max 3 guns and ammo.      (2 guns, stored ammo, clip ammo)
- Switch between inventory items.         (press 1 and 2 on the alphanumeric keyboard to switch between weapons)
- Main menu UI (Play/Exit) + level UI (Win/Lose) -> Show lose screen when player dies, and win screen on enemies defeated.       (I've added main menu for the basic play command, lose and win screen, health sidebar and ammo info UI object)
- Save system (player progress with win count and lose count).      (I have not done this yet)


## How to play and purpose
To win, the FPS must get to the safe zone (the big house to its right) without being killed by the zombies. The zombies have different kill potentials (the "boss" attack has a -30 health drop for the player, the manzombies -10, and the woman -15). The player was given initially 10 stored bullets (to later on use during reload) and a 10 bullet storage clip. Once the bullets run out he can collect the ammo boxes present in the scene by colliding with them, he may also increase his health levels by collecting the red health kit boxes.


This was done in about 21 hours on and off.
